            <h2>News</h2>
            <p>The advent of digital technology has led to the development of digital
                news tickets, which are often sent via email or accessible through mobile apps.
                <q>These digital news tickets can contain event details, access information,
                    and QR codes for streamlined check-in processes</q> that's what <cite>Brown John</cite> sayed.
                The use of news tickets is part
                of efforts to regulate &amp;organize the media's presence at news-related events,
                enhancing <b>security</b>, <b>access control</b>, and <b>event management</b>. While <i>news tickets may
                    not
                    be as commonly discussed as other types of event tickets, they are an essential tool
                    in the modern media landscape for ensuring the smooth and secure coverage of news events</i>.
